# Pending migrations

A migration is committed under `supabase/migrations/` only with the exact
version production recorded for it (see `supabase/production-ledger.json` and
`docs/control-plane/DRIFT-CONTRACT.md`). A migration that is written, reviewed
and tested but not yet applied in production waits here, and says in its own
header what it fixes.

To promote one:
1. Apply it with the Supabase MCP `apply_migration` under the same name.
2. Read its version from `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`.
3. `git mv` it to `supabase/migrations/<version>_<name>.sql` and confirm the
   file matches the stored statement byte for byte.
4. Add it to `supabase/production-ledger.json` and `core/drift-contract.json`
   and run `node scripts/control-plane-drift-contract-check.mjs`.
5. Drop any CI step that applies it from this folder.

Promoted: `action_clipping_marketplace_v1.sql` is
`20261006170955_action_clipping_marketplace_v1.sql`.

Pending: `equity_uprise_clipping_sources.sql` adds Action Network content sources
and distribution briefs. It is not applied in production. API Economic Core CI
applies it only to its isolated rebuilt database before the clipping regression.
Promote it using the steps above after production application is verified.

Pending: `commerce_stripe_reconciler_v3.sql` makes concurrent Stripe deliveries
for one sale wait for each other (a refund racing its checkout was lost),
promotes a payment the owner typed in instead of shadowing it, and keeps partial
refunds as `work_payments.refunded_cents`. The webhook calls the same functions
before and after it applies. API Economic Core CI applies it to its rebuilt
database, reruns the v1/v2 suite, then runs
`supabase/tests/commerce_stripe_reconciler_v3_regression.sql` and the two-session
race in `supabase/tests/commerce_stripe_concurrency.sh` (which fails on v2).
Production has v1 and v2 (20261006021431, 20261006023453); promote v3 with the
steps above.
