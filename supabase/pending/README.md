# Pending migrations

A migration is committed under `supabase/migrations/` only with the exact
version production recorded for it (see `supabase/production-ledger.json` and
`docs/control-plane/DRIFT-CONTRACT.md`). A migration that is written, reviewed
and tested but not yet applied in production waits here, and says in its own
header what it fixes.

To promote one:
1. Apply it with the Supabase MCP `apply_migration` under the same name.
2. Read its version from `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`.
3. `git mv` it to `supabase/migrations/<version>_<name>.sql` and confirm the
   file matches the stored statement byte for byte.
4. Add it to `supabase/production-ledger.json` and `core/drift-contract.json`
   and run `node scripts/control-plane-drift-contract-check.mjs`.
5. Drop any CI step that applies it from this folder.

Promoted: `action_clipping_marketplace_v1.sql` is
`20261006170955_action_clipping_marketplace_v1.sql`.
